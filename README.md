# SketchPlugins

These plugins are very much a work in progress, the plan is for them to only use the [SketchAPI](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI) which is still under active development too.

## Plugin Ideas:
- *Organize Layers*: rename selected layers and order them in the layer list based on their visual layout.
- *Export Page*: export all the artboards on the page to an image with artboard titles.
